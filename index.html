    <div><H1>MY FIRST WORK</H1><P>Dua Lipa is a British-Albanian singer, songwriter, and model born on August 22, 1995, in Westminster, London. Raised in a musically inclined household—her father, Dukagjin Lipa, being a musician—she developed a passion for performance early on. After attending the Sylvia Young Theatre School, she began posting song covers on YouTube, eventually landing a record deal. Her self-titled debut album in 2017 catapulted her to global fame, with the breakout single “New Rules” becoming an anthem of empowerment. She followed up with Future Nostalgia in 2020, a critically acclaimed album that earned her a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album.</p>
